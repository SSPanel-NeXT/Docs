## About software in the source

All software binaries will be installed in the `/usr/local` directory, and all configuration files will be installed in the `/etc` directory, along with the software's systemd service (if any).

Software binaries may not be built based on the source code of its Release version, but rather on the source code of its development branch, to ensure that any bugfixes and security updates are available in the source as soon as possible without relying on upstream release cycles.

The package version includes the git commit id of the source code corresponding to the binary (the gxxxxxx part of the version number).

The contents of the default configuration files included in the package may differ from those in the upstream repo.
