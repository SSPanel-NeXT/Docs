# Support Developers

Sadly, there is no three-letter agency that wants to sponsor this project yet(/s), so the development is driven by the community and unpaid volunteers.
Nothing will be put behind the paywall or require a donation to use, but the CI/Linux Mirror/CDN server doesn't grow on trees, if you are interested in supporting the project, you can support devs using the following methods:

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/catdev">Patreon (One time or monthly)</a>
<br></br>
<a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8941355-8H">Vultr Ref Link (They have GPU VMs which is quite useful for your little AI project)</a>
<br></br>
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=50f1a3b6244c">DO Ref Link</a>
